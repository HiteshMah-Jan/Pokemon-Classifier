# Pokemon-Classifier
This TensorFlow model predicts the legendary status of a Pokemon with 98% test accuracy.

The data used can be found on kaggle at:
The main.py file uses a parameter named 'Catch_Rate' and gives a 100% accuracy.(That's cheating)
However, main2.py does not involve using the above parameter and still predicts with 98% accuracy.
